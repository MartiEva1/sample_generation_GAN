# sample_generation_GAN

The goal of this report is to describe a generative model which creates new samples similar to the ones taken from a given dataset.

Two different solutions based on GANs: Generative Adversarial Networks:
- first proposed solutionon is obtained modeling the discriminatior and the generator with convolutional neural network
- the second one presents two neural networks without convolutional layers
